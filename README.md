A Short Introduction About Myself


* Who are you? What is your background?

Joshua Pearson. My background is wide and varied from trades, bachelors economics, honor's college studies, I've lived across the globe in the Middle East. I'm currently a facilities, real estate, and CAPEX manager for an oil and gas company and co-owner of a biochemistry lab and bar. 




* What are your career goals?

I'm currently interested in an opportunity to innovate within the commercial and multifamily real estate development and brokerage industry. I'd like to apply the fintech knowledge I gain to create a competitive advantage. However, I'm also open to other opportunities in fintech in the short term if they would help further develop my programming skills.


* Why did you choose FinTech as a career path? 

It's a merger of two things I both am interested in; finance/economics. And I firmly believe the future is ever more technical in nature.
